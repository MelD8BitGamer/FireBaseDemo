## 11. Add the Firebase SDK using CocoaPods to your project 

Initialize pod into your project by running ```pod init``` in Terminal. Open your Podfile and add ```pod 'Firebase/Analytics'``` to it and run ```pod install```. At this point closse Xcode and now you will have an **xcworkspace** you will be editing from now on. This xcworkspace will have your Xcode project along with the Pods that were installed.

## 14. App is verified from Firebase servers as being now connected

To verify all went well with the Firebase integration, delete the app and re-run it after adding Firebase configuration in the AppDelegate, wait a few moments for the Firebase server to detect the connection. If all went well you will receieve the verification banner below. Congratulations. ðŸ¥³
